This is the code and data used to generate the analyses and figures for the paper:

Prevalence of Learned Grapheme-Color Pairings in a Large Online Sample of Synesthetes
to be published in PLoS One
The authors are Nathan Witthoft, Jonathan Winawer, and David M Eagleman.

To generate the figures run the function s_MainAnalysis.m

To run all of the code requires matlab 2014b and the statistics toolbox. 

All of the analysis with the exception of the clustering will run with matlab 2008 or later and the statistics toolbox.  To skip the clustering comment out the line s_synclusteringAnal.

The code includes the function Shuffle.m from the Psychophysics toolbox (http://psychtoolbox.org/).   The source code can be found here:
